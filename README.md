# SnakeGame

This is my first C++ project created for educational purpose

## !!Warning!!

This project contains bad code. If you're sensitive to that please look away

It was meant to work (sometimes it doesn't) not to be efficient or expandable

## Building the project

If for some reasons you want to build this yourself, the project contains a CMakeLists.txt file

It was created directly in VisualStudio

## Platforms

It only woks on windows because of the usage of <windows.h> library

A cross-platform version won't be available in the future :)
